## Introduction

This project builds on a previously developed single-cycle RISC-V processor, which supported a defined subset of RV32I instructions.

**Supported instructions:**

- **R-type**: add, sub, and, or
- **I-type**: addi, lw
- **S-type**: sw
- **B-type**: beq

The move to a **5-stage pipelined architecture** offers significant performance gains through instruction-level parallelism. However, this introduces critical challenges in timing, data dependencies, and control flow that must be addressed through robust RTL design techniques.

## Project Objectives

- Understand pipeline hazards through real-world examples.
- Implement advanced hardware-level solutions in **Verilog RTL**.
- Learn and apply **hazard detection**, **forwarding**, and **flushing mechanisms**.
- Bridge theoretical computer architecture with hands-on RTL design.
- Build a robust, modular, and industry-aligned RISC-V pipeline processor.

## Theoretical Background

In pipelined architectures, instructions are executed in overlapping stages. This concurrency creates three types of hazards:

### 1. **Data Hazards**

Occurs when instructions depend on the results of previous instructions still in the pipeline.

- **RAW (Read After Write)** is the most common.

### 2. **Control Hazards**

Occurs from branch instructions whose outcome affects control flow.

### 3. **Structural Hazards**

Occurs when hardware resources are shared. Not present here due to resource replication.

**Summary Table:**

| Hazard Type | Cause                                            | Solution             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Data        | Instruction reads a register before it‚Äôs written | Forwarding, Stalling |
| Control     | Branch depends on result not yet available       | Flushing, Delay Slot |
| Structural  | Resource conflict                                | Resource duplication |

## Data Hazards

Consider the following example:

```assembly
sub x2, x1, x3      # x2 is written by sub
and x12, x2, x5     # x2 used as 1st operand
or  x13, x6, x2     # x2 used as 2nd operand
add x14, x2, x2     # x2 used as both operands
sw  x15, 100(x2)    # x2 used as memory base
```

All instructions depend on the result of `sub`, which is still in the pipeline. Forwarding is required to avoid incorrect execution.

## Forwarding Mechanism

Forwarding, also known as **data bypassing**, solves most data hazards by routing data directly from later pipeline stages.

**Forwarding Logic Table:**

![Forwarding Table](pictures/Forwarding_Control.png)

**Example Implementation:**

```verilog
assign alu_input_1 = (forward_a == 2'b00) ? rs1_val_idex :
                     (forward_a == 2'b10) ? alu_result_exmem :
                     (forward_a == 2'b01) ? wb_data : 32'bx;
```

**Illustration of resolved forwarding:**

## Stalling (Bubbling)

Forwarding alone fails for `LW` dependencies:

```assembly
lw x2, 20(x1)       # x2 will be available only after MEM
and x4, x2, x5      # x2 needed early in EX
```

In this case, data is only available in `MEM`. Thus, we must insert a **bubble** (NOP) to delay the dependent instruction.

**Illustration of LW hazard:**

**After stalling and resolution:**

## Control Hazards

```assembly
beq x4, x5, +12
addi x8, x0, 7   # Should be flushed if branch is taken
```

Branch outcomes are known only in `EX`, so instructions fetched after must be **flushed** if mispredicted.

## Control Hazard Solution: Flushing

We compute `branch_taken` in ID using operand forwarding when needed, and **flush** IF/ID and ID/EX when required.

```verilog
assign branch_taken = Branch && (branch_rs1_val == branch_rs2_val);
if_id IF_ID(.flush(branch_taken), ...);
id_ex ID_EX(.flush(branch_taken || stall), ...);
```

**Waveform Overview:**
- `stall` is asserted for `LW` hazard
- `branch_taken` is asserted based on forwarded values

		I_Mem[60] = 32'b00000000000000000000000000000000; // NOP
```

## RTL Design Challenges and Considerations

Throughout development several deep RTL-level challenges were encountered and addressed:

- Forwarding only from `EX/MEM` caused stale data in tight loops
- `ADDI` instructions required careful routing of `imm` into the correct MUXes
- `LW` dependencies could not be forwarded and required `stall`
- Pipeline flushing required precise ordering of control signal zeroing
- Correct handling of `x0` (always zero) was critical in forwarding logic
- Forwarding logic required bypass from ID/EX when evaluating BEQ
- Differentiation between R-type and I-type destination values in EX was needed for branch operand forwarding

Each challenge required simulation-based debugging and thoughtful design iteration.
