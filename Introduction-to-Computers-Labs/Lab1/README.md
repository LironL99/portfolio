# Lab 1: Introduction to IAR IDE, Debugging, and Assembly Language

### Overview:
In this lab, we used the **IAR Embedded Workbench** to write, debug, and run an Assembly program. The task involved comparing two arrays (ID1 and ID2) and calculating the number of differing indices, storing the result in memory.

### Key Steps:
1. **Write Assembly code** to compare two 8-element arrays.
2. **Store the differing indices count** in `Different_indices_amount`.
3. **Debug and verify** the program using IARâ€™s simulator.

### Example:
For ID1 = `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}` and ID2 = `{8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}`, differing indices are calculated and stored accordingly.
