## Course Overview
**Course Title**: Introduction to Computers (361-1-3201)  
**Instructor**: Dr. Uri Suissa  
**Laboratory Coordinator**: Hanan Ribo  

### Course Description:
In this course, I gained an in-depth understanding of the architecture and operation of digital computers. I explored fundamental concepts such as computer organization, machine language, control units, arithmetic units, memory units, and input/output systems.

### Learning Methodology:
The course consisted of lectures, tutorials, and practical lab sessions. Through hands-on experience in six laboratory experiments, I was able to apply the theoretical knowledge acquired in lectures.

### Laboratory Experiments:
The labs were designed to provide practical experience with various aspects of computer systems, including assembly language programming, GPIO operations, interrupts, real-time applications, and analog-to-digital conversions. The experiments I completed with my partner are as follows:

1. **Lab 1**: We focused on assembly language to compare arrays of identification numbers and calculate the number of differing bits.
2. **Lab 2**: We calculated the number of zero bits in elements of identification arrays.
3. **Lab 3**: We implemented PWM signal output and wave generation using GPIO.
4. **Lab 4**: We developed an interrupt-driven program that managed GPIO operations.
5. **Lab 5**: We sampled and displayed minimum and maximum voltage values in real-time using ADC.
6. **Lab 6**: We continuously updated voltage readings on an LCD based on user input.
