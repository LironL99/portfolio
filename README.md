# Liron's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a fourth-year Electrical & Computer Engineering student at Ben-Gurion University, specializing in **VLSI** and **Computers**. This portfolio showcases projects that highlight my expertise in digital design, verification, embedded development, and systems programming‚Äîdemonstrating a strong bridge between theoretical knowledge and practical, real-world applications in the semiconductor and computing industries.


## Featured Projects

### 1. Automated Log Analysis & Alerting System üõ†Ô∏è
Developed a Python-based tool for **automated log parsing, anomaly detection, and real-time email alerts**, reducing debugging time by **90%** and generating structured **PDF/HTML reports with visual insights** for verification teams.

### 2. Advanced ALU Project
This project implements an advanced Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using SystemVerilog. It features multiple operations including addition, subtraction, bitwise operations, multiplication, and shifts, along with an advanced testbench incorporating randomized testing, deterministic edge tests, assertions, and functional coverage.  
Future enhancements include improved coverage (e.g., cross coverage between opcode and inputs), additional features like division and overflow/zero flags, and integration of advanced verification methodologies (e.g., UVM).

### 3. Ultrasonic Sensor Servo Control Project üì°
This project creates a **distance measurement system** using an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor, providing visual feedback through red LEDs based on the measured distance. The system features a radar-like display using Processing, which visually represents distance readings in real time and allows users to adjust the scanning speed via a potentiometer. The project enhanced my skills in wiring, integrating components, debugging, and programming within the Arduino IDE using C++.

### 5. Integrated Circuits and Introduction to VLSI Tasks
This repository includes two major tasks focusing on VLSI design, utilizing Cadence Virtuoso and advanced CAD tools. The projects cover:

1. **MOSFET, Inverter & Buffer Design** ‚Äì Device-level design and optimization of basic digital components.
2. **Digital Logic Blocks** ‚Äì Design and testing of components like adders, multiplexers, and barrel shifters.

Extensive testing was conducted using simulations to ensure adherence to design rules and performance metrics. Key focus areas include low power design, timing optimization, and parasitic extraction.
