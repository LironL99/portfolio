# Liron's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a student of Electrical and Computer Engineering, focusing on VLSI and Computers tracks. This portfolio showcases a variety of projects that highlight my expertise in digital design, systems programming, machine learning, and computer architecture.

## Featured Projects

### 1. 4-bit ALU
This project implements a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog language. The ALU can perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, and logical operations, serving as a foundational digital design component.

### 2. Integrated Circuits and Introduction to VLSI Tasks
This repository includes two major tasks focusing on VLSI design, utilizing Cadence Virtuoso and advanced CAD tools. The projects cover:

1. **MOSFET, Inverter & Buffer Design** – Device-level design and optimization of basic digital components.
2. **Digital Logic Blocks** – Design and testing of components like adders, multiplexers, and barrel shifters.

Extensive testing was conducted using simulations to ensure adherence to design rules and performance metrics. Key focus areas include low power design, timing optimization, and parasitic extraction.
