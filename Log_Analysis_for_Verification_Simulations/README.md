# Automated Log Analysis & Alerting System for Verification Engineers

## Overview
This project is designed to automate the analysis of verification simulation logs, providing valuable insights into test performance, error trends, and anomalies. By integrating data visualization, anomaly detection, and automated email notifications, this tool enhances debugging efficiency and test coverage analysis, making it a valuable asset in the verification and validation process.

## Key Features
✅ **Automated Log Parsing & Analysis** – Extracts and categorizes INFO, WARNING, and ERROR messages from simulation logs.  
✅ **Anomaly Detection** – Identifies test cases with abnormally long runtimes or high error rates.  
✅ **Data Visualization** – Generates clear and professional bar charts and scatter plots to highlight test behavior.  
✅ **Comprehensive Report Generation** – Produces structured reports in PDF and HTML formats, summarizing key findings.  
✅ **Automated Alert System** – Triggers alerts when error counts exceed predefined thresholds or runtime anomalies are detected.  
✅ **Email Notifications** – Sends automated alerts with attached reports for immediate visibility.  
✅ **Scalability & Configurability** – Easily configurable thresholds, email settings, and log sources for adaptability to different verification environments.

## Why This Project Matters
This tool significantly reduces the manual effort required to analyze verification results, enabling engineers to focus on debugging rather than data processing. It ensures:
- **Early detection of critical issues** before they escalate.
- **Improved efficiency in verification cycles**, leading to faster design iterations.
- **Standardized and automated reporting**, ensuring consistency across test results.

## How It Works
1. **Execute the script:**
   ```bash
   python Log_Analysis.py
   ```
2. **The script will:**
   - Parse simulation logs and categorize messages.
   - Identify recurring errors and warnings for trend analysis.
   - Detect runtime anomalies using statistical thresholds.
   - Generate structured reports (PDF & HTML) including graphical insights.
   - Log triggered alerts into `alerts.log` for traceability.
   - Send email notifications with the generated reports attached.
