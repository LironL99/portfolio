# Log Analysis and Automated Alerts System

## Overview
This project automates the analysis of verification simulation logs, providing insights into errors, warnings, and runtime anomalies. It also generates comprehensive reports (PDF & HTML) and sends email alerts for critical issues.

## Features
âœ… **Log Parsing & Analysis** â€“ Extracts and categorizes INFO, WARNING, and ERROR messages from logs.  
âœ… **Runtime Anomaly Detection** â€“ Identifies test cases with unusually long runtimes.  
âœ… **Graphical Visualization** â€“ Generates bar charts and scatter plots for insights.  
âœ… **Automated Report Generation** â€“ Creates professional reports in PDF and HTML formats.  
âœ… **Email Notifications** â€“ Sends alerts when test failures exceed thresholds, attaching reports.  
âœ… **Alert Logging** â€“ Saves all triggered alerts in `alerts.log`.

## How It Works
1. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python Log_Analysis.py
   ```
2. **The script performs:**
   - Log parsing and message categorization.
   - Statistical analysis of recurring errors/warnings.
   - Runtime outlier detection.
   - Report generation (PDF & HTML).
   - Email notifications with attached reports.

## Example Output
```
Most Common Errors:
- Memory corruption detected at address 0x1ACF (4 occurrences)
- Assertion failed at module 'ALU' (7 occurrences)

Most Common Warnings:
- Timing violation at register interface (8 occurrences)
- Voltage fluctuation detected (7 occurrences)

Test Summary:
Test 001: Infos=2, Errors=1, Warnings=0, Runtime=33.7 sec
Test 002: Infos=2, Errors=1, Warnings=1, Runtime=39.1 sec
...
Outlier Tests: ['003', '015', '033']
```

## Reports & Alerts
- **Generated Reports:**
  - `log_analysis_report.pdf` â€“ A structured PDF report with data and graphs.
  - `log_analysis_report.html` â€“ A web-friendly, interactive report.
  - `alerts.log` â€“ A record of all critical alerts triggered.
- **Email Alerts:**
  - If a test exceeds the error threshold or runtime anomaly is detected, an email notification is sent.
  - Reports are automatically attached to the email.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib numpy fpdf smtplib
  ```
- Configure email SMTP settings (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) in the script.

## Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ **Slack Integration** â€“ Send alerts directly to Slack channels.  
ðŸ”¹ **Machine Learning Anomaly Detection** â€“ Predict failures before they happen.  
ðŸ”¹ **CI/CD Pipeline Integration** â€“ Automate testing with Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

## Conclusion
This tool enhances verification efficiency by automating log analysis, visualization, and failure detection. It helps engineers quickly identify issues, optimize test performance, and streamline debugging.

ðŸš€ **Perfect for verification engineers looking to automate and optimize their workflow!**
