# Task 1: Basic Simulations and Inverter Construction

### Task Overview
This task involves performing basic simulations, familiarizing with tools, and constructing an inverter.

### Part A: Understanding Devices
- Devices with minimum length and width were used, calculated using the formula: \( W = (10G \times (420)) \, \text{nm} \).
- IV curves for basic devices were generated using the PDK.
- A schematic with NMOS and PMOS transistors was created, with voltage sources connected to gates and drains.
- A DC Sweep simulation was run on V_DS and V_GS, documenting I_DS for both types of transistors.
- The threshold voltage V_T for each transistor was calculated and documented.

### Part B: Inverter Construction
- A schematic of an inverter was designed, and simulations were run to achieve optimal performance.
- T_pHL and T_pLH delays were measured and reported.
- For the layout design, symbols for the inverter were created, the layout was drawn, and DRC issues were ensured to be absent before conducting LVS.

### Part C: Buffer Construction
- Two schematics for the buffer were designed: one implemented with transistors and the other using the inverters created earlier.
- Symbols for both cells were created, and simulation results were displayed.

### Collaboration
Collaboration with a partner throughout this task enhanced the understanding of VLSI design and simulation.
