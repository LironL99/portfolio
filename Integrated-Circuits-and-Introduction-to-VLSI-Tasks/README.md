# Integrated Circuits and Introduction to VLSI Tasks

### Course Overview
This course focused on the fundamental principles of integrated circuits and very-large-scale integration (VLSI). It provided an in-depth understanding of **VLSI fabrication processes, design rules,** and the operation of various **digital and analog circuits**. Topics included **MOS transistor operation, combinational logic, low power design techniques, timing analysis,** and **memory architectures**. Advanced **CAD tools** were utilized to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios.

### Task Overview
The course included two significant tasks aimed at enhancing the understanding of VLSI design and simulation:

#### Task 1: Basic Simulations and Inverter and Buffer Construction
- This task involved performing **basic simulations**, familiarizing with tools, and constructing an **inverter and a buffer**.
- Key components included understanding devices, generating **IV curves**, designing schematics, and measuring performance metrics.

#### Task 2: MUX and Barrel Shift Register Construction
- The focus was on constructing and simulating a **1x2 MUX** and an **8-bit Barrel Shift Register** using **Cadence Virtuoso**.
- The tasks included schematic design, performance measurement, and layout design while adhering to **DRC** and **LVS** requirements.

### Collaboration
Collaboration occurred with a partner throughout the tasks, which enhanced the overall understanding of VLSI design principles and their practical applications.
