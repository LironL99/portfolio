# Integrated Circuits and Introduction to VLSI Tasks

### Course Overview
This course focused on **integrated circuits** and **VLSI (very-large-scale integration)**, covering fundamental principles like **fabrication processes, design rules**, and operational behaviors of **digital and analog circuits**. Key areas included **MOS transistor operation, combinational logic, low power design**, **timing analysis**, and **memory architectures**. Advanced **CAD tools**, particularly **Cadence Virtuoso**, were used extensively to bridge theory with hands-on design practice.

### Task Overview
The course featured two hands-on tasks utilizing **Cadence Virtuoso** to deepen practical VLSI skills in device simulation, schematic design, layout, and performance analysis:

#### Task 1: Basic Simulations and Inverter and Buffer Construction
- Focused on **simulating** device behaviors and constructing fundamental components: an **inverter** and a **buffer**.
- Key steps included generating **IV curves**, calculating **propagation delays**, designing the **schematic and layout**, and performing **DRC** and **LVS** checks to ensure integrity.
- **Parasitic Extraction (PEX)** was used to assess the real-world impact of parasitics on performance.

#### Task 2: MUX and Barrel Shift Register Construction
- Built on the foundational skills from Task 1 to design and analyze more complex components: a **1x2 MUX** and an **8-bit Barrel Shift Register**.
- Similar steps were followed: **schematic design, delay calculation, layout creation,** and **DRC/LVS checks**. **PEX** was also performed to evaluate parasitic effects on these more intricate circuits.

### Highlights of the Design Process
Both tasks followed a structured approach:
1. **Schematic Design**: Starting with basic device selection and connectivity.
2. **Performance Analysis**: Calculating delays and generating performance metrics.
3. **Layout Design and Verification**: Ensuring compactness, DRC compliance, and schematic alignment.
4. **Parasitic Analysis**: Using PEX to simulate real-world circuit behavior.

### Collaboration
These projects were completed in collaboration with **Yuval Dahan**, which enhanced our understanding of collaborative VLSI design and simulation.

### Skills and Tools
This course reinforced:
- Proficiency with **Cadence Virtuoso** for CAD and simulation.
- Layout verification with **DRC/LVS** checks and parasitic analysis with **PEX**.
- Hands-on experience with **MOSFET device physics**, **timing analysis**, and **complex circuit design**.
